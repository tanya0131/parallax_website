               Everyone knows that exposure to sunlight helps the body create Vitamin D, which leads to healthy bones and is medically proven to improve one’s mood. (Of course, we also know that over-exposure to sunshine can be harmful, which is why we recommend a good and regular application of sunblock lotions and creams for every passenger on board.) And the fresh air of the great outdoors beats the recycled air conditioned air of your home, office and car every time.Getting away from the workaday world, even if just for an hour or two, can work wonders in reducing your overall level of stress and tension.

                Camping is a form of outdoor recreation or outdoor education involving overnight stays with a basic temporary shelter such as a tent. Camping can also include a recreational vehicle, sheltered cabins, a permanent tent, a shelter such as a bivy or tarp, or no shelter at all. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors, in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or an educational experience. Spending the night away from home distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other outdoor activities.Camping can be enjoyed throughout all four seasons, but summers are the most popular season for camping since the weather is generally warm and dry.

When you go camping, you get the wondrous scents of the outdoors, as well as the smell of dinner cooking over an open fire.One of the best and most important aspects of camping is how it helps you build and strengthen relationships. When you go camping with friends or family, you get a chance to talk and visit without distraction, even late into the night.
